# Sudoku-Solver

The sudoku solver uses back-tracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku problem.
Currently, the board has to be typed in the algorithm.
Further development will include integration of a Convolutional Neural Network.
Input to CNN will be an image of Sudoku problem, probably from newspaper, and it will identify the digits from the image and will create the array of board to be fed to the back-tracking algorithm.
